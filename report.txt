Worked with Jonathan Vasquez (student id 01440932). Chhayhout’s Work

For this project, we used angular 5 and firebase. We uploaded the build project onto the cs server. if you want to run it on your pc, just run the command (ng serve) in the folder. 
I added pictures of the firebase in the files that contain adddelete images, storage, and database. I created all the firebase files as well as some html files. Jonathan took care of all the front end while I took care of the backend of our application. Jonathan’s Work
